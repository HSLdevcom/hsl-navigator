HSL Navigator
=============


HSL Navigator is an open-source project initiated by Helsinki Region Transport HSL to eventually surpass its current journey planner service. The project aims to produce a new type of routing service with turn-by-turn navigation to cyclists and public transport passengers. The project also tests how to create a public service based on open-source development, various sources of open data as well as user-generated content.
